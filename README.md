# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step 1:
Import pandas module and import the required data set.

## Step 2:
Find the null values and count them.

## Step 3:
Count number of left values.

## Step 4:
From sklearn import LabelEncoder to convert string values to numerical values.

## Step 5:
From sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split.

## Step 6:
Assign the train dataset and test dataset.

## Step 7:
From sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier.

## Step 8:
Use criteria as entropy.

## Step 9:
From sklearn import metrics.

## Step 10:
Find the accuracy of our model and predict the require values.

## Program:
```
